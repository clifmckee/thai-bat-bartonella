Bartonellae are phylogenetically diverse, intracellular bacteria commonly found in mammals.
Previous studies have demonstrated that bats have a high prevalence and diversity of
*Bartonella* infections globally. Isolates (n = 42) were obtained from five bat species in four
provinces of Thailand and analyzed using sequences of the citrate synthase gene (*gltA*).
Sequences clustered into seven distinct genogroups; four of these genogroups displayed
similarity with *Bartonella* spp. sequences from other bats in Southeast Asia, Africa, and
Eastern Europe. Thirty of the isolates representing these seven genogroups were further
characterized by sequencing four additional loci (*ftsZ*, *nuoG*, *rpoB*, and ITS) to clarify their
evolutionary relationships with other Bartonella species and to assess patterns of diversity
among strains. Among the seven genogroups, there were differences in the number of
sequence variants, ranging from 1-5, and the amount of nucleotide divergence, ranging
from 0.035-3.9%. Overall, these seven genogroups meet the criteria for distinction as novel
*Bartonella* species, with sequence divergence among genogroups ranging from 6.4-15.8%.
Evidence of intra- and intercontinental phylogenetic relationships and instances of homologous
recombination among *Bartonella* genogroups in related bat species were found in Thai
bats.
